# MSX-Tetris-Codegolf

My 1994 MSX "Kort maar Krachtig" (short but powerfull) implementation of Tetris

It is three lines of BASIC code. Only 760 bytes.

To see how it works you can [run it on WebMSX](https://webmsx.org/?basic_run=tetris.bas&disk=https://github.com/Jacco/MSX-Tetris-Codegolf/blob/master/tetris.dsk?raw=true)

Keys to play the game:
  - ,            rotate left
  - .            rotate right
  - arrow down   faster down
  - arrow left   move left
  - arrow right  move right

Note: the steering is delays one cycle for smaller code size. Makes it harder to play :-)

First publication was in MCCM 68 in 1994:
